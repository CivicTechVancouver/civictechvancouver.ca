All of the software and datasets will be provided ahead of time, and are free.</p> <p>Robert is a full time analyst at a startup in Vancouver, and a part time chef everywhere else.

Previously an instructor at Brainstation for their Data Analytics class, he is usually found at a coffee shop on Main St. working on R or reading a cookbook.</p> <p>In this event, Robert will be going over how to wrangle/munging raw datasets, to get useful information out of them, and finally provide a tutorial on vis.

This approach can be adopted by any community, big or small.<br/>- Finalists will receive support to develop their smart cities proposals. Winning communities will be awarded with prize money to help implement them.<br/><a href=\"https://impact.canada.ca/en/challenges/smart-cities\" class=\"linkified\">https://impact.canada.ca/en/challenges/smart-cities</a><br/>---<br/>The City of Vancouver and the City of Surrey are partnering to compete for $50 million in the Government of Canada\u2019s Smart Cities Challenge.
